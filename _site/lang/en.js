  <div>
    <p>I am a PhD student under the Spanish National FPU Fellowship. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and a Master of Research in Systems and Computing Engineering, both from the University of Cádiz, where I received the Extraordinary Master's Degree Award for Best Academic Record. I am a member of the GOAL research group [TIC-259] at the University of Cádiz, as well as a member of the IEEE society. </p>

    <h2 class='title'> Main research</h2>

    <p> My PhD research focuses on Green Software. It is built on three main pillars:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Automatic optimization of software to generate higher performance and/or greener versions</li>
      <li> Green software for the Internet of Things </li>
      <li> Green video games </li>
    </ol>

    <p> Currently, I am developing the third pillar, concentrating my research on improving the energy consumption and performance of video games by applying AI-based algorithms. </p>
    <p> I hold a total of five publications in high-impact research journals indexed in the JCR: three in Q1 and two in Q2. In 2023, I received the Cepsa Foundation Chair Award for the article titled "Optimal Battery Management Strategies for Plug-in Electric Hybrid Buses on Routes Including Green Corridor." These publications cover topics such as software optimization, code obfuscation, optimization of public transport emissions, deep learning models, and the application of artificial intelligence in video games.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I have contributed to six international conferences, receiving the Best Paper Award at the 32nd INGEGRAF International Conference held in Cádiz, Spain, for the paper titled "Multivariable Visualization Tool of the Performance of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Buses." On the national level, I have presented six articles, winning the Best Paper Award at the III Spanish Video Game Congress held in A Coruña, Spain, for the work titled "Optimización automática del videojuego Doom para un rendimiento óptimo en Steam Deck." </p>
